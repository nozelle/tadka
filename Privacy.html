              <p>Last updated: 14th October 2023</p>
              <p>At Tadka Studios, your privacy and the protection of your data is our top priority. All data collected, both personal and non-personal, is protected with the highest global standards.</p>
              <p>Tadka Studios is operated by Goodwind Technologies Private Limited.</p>
              <p>At Tadka Studios, your privacy and the protection of your data is our top priority. All data collected, both personal and non-personal, is protected with the highest global standards. As we believe your personal data is and should always remain yours, we have a strong privacy policy in place. This policy is fully compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as the related laws and regulations in place at Singapore.</p>
              <p>The contents of this privacy policy are applicable to the website www.tadkastudios.com and use of the services provided by this site to the user.</p>
              <p>1. Notice</p>
              <p>Whenever we request information that can be used to personally identify you, you will explicitly be asked to provide it and/or give us permission to use it. This information is requested by our system whenever confirmation of your permission is required to continue (e.g. asking for permission for the use of cookies when you visit our site, asking for your payment information when you sign up).</p>
              <p>2. Your consent</p>
              <p>You will always have the choice whether to give us permission to process your information or not.</p>
              <p>With data that is not essential to the core functionality of our services (e.g. cookies for marketing purposes, company name, etc.) you are able to decline permission without any consequences to your access to Tadka Studios.</p>
              <p>If you choose to decline the use of essential information for the use of our services (e.g. essential cookies, payment information, e-mail address), we will be unable to give you access to all aspects of Tadka Studios that require such information to function. Whether any given information is essential to our services or not will be explicitly indicated when you are asked to provide or give permission for us to use such information.</p>
              <p>By agreeing to this privacy policy and providing us with your personal information you consent to us processing said information as described in this privacy policy.</p>
              <p>3. Usage</p>
              <p>3.1. Data we collect</p>
              <p>We collect various forms of personal identifiable information. This includes all information which could directly be used to identify you. This includes your name, e-mail address, payment information and more.</p>
              <p>We also collect data based on your usage of our platform with our optional cookies. This data is collected and processed fully anonymously, meaning it can not be traced back to you or your person.</p>
              <p>3.2. How we use your data</p>
              <p>We use your personally identifiable information for the following purposes:</p>
              <ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;">
                <li>
                  <p>Provide you with access to all of Tadka Studios’s features</p>
                </li>
                <li >
                  <p>Process your payments</p>
                </li>
                <li >
                  <p>Inform you about important information regarding Tadka Studios, as well as any other information you choose to opt in to.</p>
                </li>
                <li >
                  <p>Contact you to inform you about the status of your order, if there is a problem with your order, if you request us to via our support services, or for other reasons you may opt in to.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>We use anonymous usage data to analyze the use of our platform by our users so we can improve our services.</p>
              <p>Data regarding the use of our platform by our users may be shared with third parties we work with to improve our services and keep our activities running. This includes organizations like marketing agencies. This data will always be made fully anonymous before it’s shared.</p>
              <p>Some of your personal identifiable information may also need to be shared with our partners to provide you with our essential services. Examples include shipping companies when we need to physically mail you a product. In these cases, these partners will only be provided with the information absolutely necessary to provide their service.</p>
              <p>If a legal request for your personally identifiable information or other information regarding you or your person is requested by a federal court, judge or law enforcement, we are legally required to provide them with your personal identifiable information. In these cases, we may do so without your permission and without informing you.</p>
              <p>Outside of these three categories, no party outside of Tadka Studios will ever get access to your personal information unless you specifically grant us permission. If we do wish to share your information with an external party outside of these three categories, we will always explicitly ask you for permission first.</p>
              <p>4. Retention of information</p>
              <p>We retain your information as long as this is necessary to provide you with our services. All personal identifiable information will be deleted when you inform us you wish to stop using our services (e.g. by deleting your account), when your subscription expires, or when you explicitly request us to delete it. Once your request has been submitted and confirmed, your information will be deleted within 14 days.</p>
              <p>Information may be retained for longer if this is necessary for legal requirements. If required by law or ordered by a federal judge or court, we may retain information for longer and/or share it with said organization.</p>
